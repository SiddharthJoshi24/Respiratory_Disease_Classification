# Auscultation Sound and Meta-Data Analysis for Respiratory Disease Classification with Machine Learning
The proposed project employs a lightweight and efficient disease classification from audio recordings using a deep learning architecture built on a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) coupled with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)
Along with XGBoost classifier for meta data
